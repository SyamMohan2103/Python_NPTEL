MERGE SORT:
  - different strategy: - divide the array into two equal parts
						- separately sort left and right halves
						- Combine the two sorted halves to get the full array sorted
  - Combining sorted lists - Combine into a sorted list C
						   - Compare first element of A and B move the smaller one to C
						   - Move it into C
						   - Repeat until all elements in A and B are over
						   - Merging A and B
  - Merge Sort - divides the list into two parts and sorts them and merges into another sorted list
  - THIS TECHNIQUE IS CALLED "DIVIDE AND CONQUER"
  

MERGE SORT ANALYSIS:
  - A merging algorithm that takes two sorted lists A and B, and combines them by doing a scan over all the elements
  - O(max(m,n)) = O(n) if m~=n
  
  - T(n) = 1
  - T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
		 = O(n log n)

Variations on merge - union of two sorted list
					- intersection
					- list difference

Limitations:
 - creates a new array
 - inherently recursive - recursive call and return are expensive
